# Twilio-Send-SMS
Send SMS using Python through Twilio

You will need to set up a Twilio account and download the Twilio package in order to use the libraries. If you have PIP, you can call this from the command line: 

pip install Twilio

Once you have an account, you will need the SID, Auth Token, and Twilio Phone #. Do not share these credentials with anyone! Add these variables in the appropriate locations in the file. Set the phone number of the user who will receive the SMS message and change the message to whatever you'd like. 

I do not advise using this code to spam people's phone numbers. This code is meant to help users become familiar with the Twilio library. There may be charges for using the Twilio account. Read the User Agreement from Twilio to understand the full details. 

Good luck, and have fun!
